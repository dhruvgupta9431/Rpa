influence, process, or dependencies.
2 Develop Empathy Map collaboratively with users of what they say, do, think and feel; identify patterns in them
and discuss them with users.
3 Develop As-Is-Scenario Map: Take a closer look at the problem or opportunity space that you want to impact
by understanding what the user is doing, thinking and feeling. Identify different phases, sub areas that are
particularly positive or negative for your user and blank areas where you need to learn more.
4 Big Idea Vignettes: From As-Is-Scenario map identify needs statement, a user story, a Hill, or just a pain
point. Generate ideas, not features and diverge on big ideas. Cluster, title, and discuss those ideas and
converge on a set that you would want to advance.
5 Prepare a Prioritization Grid: Evaluate each idea from low to high on two parameters "Value to User" and
"Feasibility for the team". categorize them into "No Brainsers"; "Big Bets" and "Utilities"; "Un-wise" to work
upon.
6 Develop Needs Statements: Setup the activity as [Our user] needs a way to [addresses this need] so that
they [benefit in this way.]. Uncover their needs and Cluster them.
7 Develop Storyboards: Identify a character, a setting, and a plot. Illustrate your story. Play back and discuss.
8 Crafting a Hill i. e. Develop Who, What and Wow: Start with the user you want to serve. Specify the outcome
you want to enable them to achieve, and the differentiator that will make your solution worth their while.
9 Develop To-be Scenario Map: Develop artifacts to put in front of stakeholders and users to align on your
team's intent. Use them as you are coming up with potential solutions to see how your ideas would fit within
your user's world, and how they might address their needs.
