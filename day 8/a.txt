"Ecommerce" or "electronic commerce" is the trading of goods and services on the internet. It is your bustling city center or brick-and-mortar shop translated into zeroes and ones on the internet superhighway. An estimated 2.14 billion people worldwide buy goods and services online, and the number of Prime members shopping Amazon stores globally now tops 200 million.Ecommerce is one way people buy and sell things in retail. Some companies sell products online only, while other sellers use ecommerce as a part of a broader strategy that includes physical stores and other distribution channels. Either way, ecommerce allows startups, small businesses, and large companies to sell products at scale and reach customers across the world.
